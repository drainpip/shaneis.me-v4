title: 'On Managing Remote'
description: "There's a lot of BS swirling around these days about companies working remotely. It seems like an endless stream of leaders are saying their companies are so much worse having gone remote. I personally think that if your business can go remote, it should. Leaders will have to work harder and be better, and this is the real problem."

I've been working remotely since 2017, and I've seen the company I work for adjust how they work with remote employees evolve quite a bit in that time. Pre-pandemic we were making all communications remote-first as we could. It was nowhere near 100% asynchronous, but we were getting to the point that all meetings were over Zoom even for people in the office. We were a remote company because we trusted our people, and we wanted to hire the best people we could afford no matter where they lived.

Today there's a big reversal from the "remote-first utopia" that was being created during the beginning of the pandemic that is pulling people back into the office. There are many factors to this, some of which are valid in my opinion, but a vast majority of the things I've heard as reasons - stated publicly mind you - are simply due to poor leadership. Besides needing to justify the rent you're paying at the swanky downtown office, a majority of the leaders state publicly that there is no substitute for being in person every day because it's impossible to have those "water cooler" conversations or ad hoc whiteboarding sessions where so much creativity flows when you're remote. People are so much less efficient, and there's no way to ensure they're are working all day.

Bullshit.

### Why do we like being remote?

I would like to explain how it looks and feels like when you're doing remote-first well, but before I do I think we should check in on some of the reasons why having people work remotely is a good thing.

#### Pros

From an employer's perspective:

* You can choose talent from anywhere in the world if you're heavily async, however it's probably easiest to stick within a few timezones either direction. This is vastly superior to the talent pool you'll be stuck with in the metropolitan area around whatever offices you'll have access to.
* You won't need a massive footprint for offices, this could add up to (sometimes many) multiple millions per year in savings you can put into the business.
* Being remote-first today is a differentiator in grabbing the attention of top talent.
* If you have processes in place to make remote-first work well, your business will be naturally more lean and efficient than your competition.

From an employee's perspective:

* You can live anywhere, not just in the expensive metro where the most offices are, this can make a higher salary go much further as a bonus. Or you can work from anywhere, taking extended vacations and working while living the life of a tourist.
* You'll have more free time in your day not having to commute, and more flexibility to take care of things during the week that are mostly impossible to do without taking time off.
* Taking care of children's school schedule, or being a caretaker to a loved one, is something you can build your day around instead of the opposite.
* It's easy to start and stop work when you want, it's not necessary to clock 8+ hours just because everyone else is still at their desks in the office.
* Much easier to have longer blocks of flow state without interruptions for deep thinking and problem solving.

To be fair, it's not all rainbows and unicorns.

#### Cons

From an employer's perspective:

* Morale is particularly difficult to manage through challenging times.
* Bringing people together, when it makes sense, is quite expensive. Often this is much cheaper than having offices.
* Managing processes can take more effort, knowing when something is wrong can take more time.

From an employee's perspective:

* There can be real loneliness compared to being in a thriving office, especially depending on your living situation. Humans thrive human connection, and although it's possible on a video call it's not the same as having ambient civilization all around you. That said, how many offices are thriving?
* It takes real discipline to stay on task and actively working. Sometimes this is the same or worse in office for different reasons.
* Some people don't know they dislike it until they try it.
* Getting to know your coworkers takes more effort.

In most situations where having a remote workforce is possible, both employers and employees agree that the pros outweigh the cons. In cases where employers think the opposite, you'll have things like forced hybrid or full return to office mandates. I'm not going to say that all of those situations will lead to worse productivity and morale, but it sure does make my job hiring fully remote easier.

### How to do remote well

I think it's my job, and the job of the company's leadership, to make the hard parts of remote work better. Part of this is leaning into what it means to be a remote company, the rest is manufacturing bonding by giving time and money to do so. Leaning into remote work means allowing your culture to give the freedom to people to schedule their own day, creating a culture of async-first communication, and encouraging video-on calls when the need for realtime communication is needed. I say allowing your culture to go this direction because it will naturally do so, unless you get in its way. You can force people to be on video calls all day that don't need to be so you can "see" them working. You can force people to work specific hours and log their time. That won't help you out with productivity and efficiency, I promise you. If you trust people to do what you're paying them to do they'll give you more than you would ask for if you can give up that illusion of control.

Remote work can fail if we're left to Zoom and Slack only for long enough. It's really important to bring teams together regularly - at minimum once per year, hopefully you can pull off more. I totally understand that this can feel impossible, for instance I've not met any of my Indian colleagues face-to-face. There are things that most businesses will almost automatically agree to bring folks into the same room, like planning or architecture, basically talking over future plans in the face of uncertainty with a good brainstorming session. These things *can* be accomplished over a video call, but they're so much better in person. I think also things like celebrating the successful completion of a huge project, or even just getting together because we haven't in a year are still totally valid, but I've personally had difficulty getting budget just for that. It's still important to try, and show that you're trying.

I like to encourage messing around when the team comes together for Zoom meetings, be they sprint ceremonies or whatever. Not only do I encourage it, but I start it. We like to joke around with each other and make each other laugh. I have a few games that I regularly do: give a "gold star" to whoever had the most boring weekend on Mondays, encourage eating tacos every Tuesday, ceaseless "dad jokes", the list goes on. Once people feel comfortable they'll start participating, or even split conversations off on tangents. I feel like this is so important that I'm fine with sprint ceremonies being compressed at the end instead. Something I find myself saying regularly is, "I guess we should do some work now."

If you're able to bring this level of fun to the tedium of Agile scrum, I promise the team will be having even more fun together as they spend time randomly on calls helping each other out or even just chatting for no reason but to catch up. There are actually things I've seen my teams do where someone invariably will come up with a weekly "fun thread" on Slack where everyone will take turns sharing pictures or stories about what's happening in their lives. They'll hop on Zooms just to each lunch with each other. All of this makes the working part of work so much less of a chore, but in my opinion it's a critical part of a team's growth toward performing at a high level. This is true in a non-remote setting, but this needs to be fostered and even manufactured over a video call so it's got to be something you manage directly.

When you do remote-first well, you'll be rewarded with a much happier and effective group of people working for you. They have the time to live the lives of modern adults, where flexibility is paramount for everyone. This flexibility along with the free time of not having to worry about a commute every day make it ideal especially for families, but even that single twenty-something is going to get something out of being able to step away from their desk to go to a dentist appointment without hesitation. Trust is a two way street, and in my opinion is your most important asset as a leader: both in cultivating it for yourself and giving it to your team. All talk of keeping track of what people do every minute of the day and the need to watch over them goes right out the window when you do this right. You're giving your team trust, time, flexibility and in return they'll give you more, and gladly, than they could give to a job forcing them into an office every day because of water cooler conversations.
