title: 'On Managing Remote'
description: "There's a lot of BS swirling around these days about companies working remotely. It seems like an endless stream of leaders are saying their companies are so much worse having gone remote. I personally think that if your business can go remote, it should. Leaders will have to work harder and be better, and this is the real problem."

I've been working remotely since 2017, and I've seen the company I work for adjust how they work with remote employees evolve quite a bit in that time. Pre-pandemic we were making all communications remote-first as we could. It was nowhere near 100% asynchronous, but we were getting to the point that all meetings were over Zoom even for people in the office. We were a remote company because we trusted our people, and we wanted to hire the best people we could afford no matter where they lived.

Today there's a big reversal from the "remote-first utopia" that was being created during the beginning of the pandemic that is pulling people back into the office. There are many factors to this, some of which are valid in my opinion, but a vast majority of the things I've heard as reasons - stated publicly mind you - are simply due to poor leadership. Besides needing to justify the rent you're paying at the swanky downtown office, a majority of the leaders state publicly that there is no substitute for being in person every day because it's impossible to have those "water cooler" conversations or ad hoc whiteboarding sessions where so much creativity flows when you're remote. People are so much less efficient, and there's no way to ensure they're are working all day.

Bullshit.

### Why do we like being remote?

I would like to explain how it looks and feels like when you're doing remote-first well, but before I do I think we should check in on some of the reasons why having people work remotely is a good thing.

#### Pros

From an employer's perspective:

* You can choose talent from anywhere in the world if you're heavily async, however it's probably easiest to stick within a few timezones either direction. This is vastly superior to the talent pool you'll be stuck with in the metropolitan area around whatever offices you'll have access to.
* You won't need a massive footprint for offices, this could add up to (sometimes many) multiple millions per year in savings you can put into the business.
* Being remote-first today is a differentiator in grabbing the attention of top talent.
* If you have processes in place to make remote-first work well, your business will be naturally more lean and efficient than your competition.

From an employee's perspective:

* You can live anywhere, not just in the expensive metro where the most offices are, this can make a higher salary go much further as a bonus. Or you can work from anywhere, taking extended vacations and working while living the life of a tourist.
* You'll have more free time in your day not having to commute, and more flexibility to take care of things during the week that are mostly impossible to do without taking time off.
* Taking care of children's school schedule, or being a caretaker to a loved one, is something you can build your day around instead of the opposite.
* It's easy to start and stop work when you want, it's not necessary to clock 8+ hours just because everyone else is still at their desks in the office.
* Much easier to have longer blocks of flow state without interruptions for deep thinking and problem solving.

#### Cons

From an employer's perspective:

* Morale is particularly difficult to manage through challenging times.
* Bringing people together, when it makes sense, is quite expensive.
* Managing processes can take more effort, knowing when something is wrong can take more time.

From an employee's perspective:

* There can be real loneliness compared to being in a thriving office, especially depending on your living situation.
* It takes real discipline to stay on task and actively working. Sometimes this is the same or worse in office for different reasons.
* Some people don't know they dislike it until they try it.
* Getting to know your coworkers takes more effort.

In most situations where having a remote workforce is possible, both employers and employees agree that the pros outweigh the cons. In cases where employers think the opposite, you'll have things like forced hybrid or full return to office mandates. I'm not going to say that all of those situations will lead to worse productivity and morale, but it sure does make my job hiring fully remote easier.

### How to do remote well

I think it's my job, and the job of the company's leadership, to make the hard parts of remote work better. Part of this is leaning into what it means to be a remote company, the rest is manufacturing bonding by giving time and money to do so. Leaning into remote work means allowing your culture to give the freedom to people to schedule their own day, creating a culture of async-first communication, and encouraging video-on calls when the need for realtime communication is needed. I say allowing your culture to go this direction because it will naturally do so, unless you get in its way. You can force people to be on video calls all day that don't need to be so you can "see" them working. You can force people to work specific hours and log their time. 

You could also do all the remote side well enough, but forget that teams of humans need to get together from time to time and do things together that are extremely difficult to do remote. For example: long term planning, deep architectural explorations, or really any time there are lots of voices and opinions that all need to be heard at once. Also, celebrations of any type are extremely hollow in a remote setting. Sometimes getting together because you haven't in a long time is a good enough reason.

`Manufacture the bonding - set aside time for face to face time, make space for and encourage non-work communication, mess around during meetings.`

`Understand remote isn't good in some situations - many voices and opinions; Bring people together from time to time - having a small office where it's needed will help those that prefer some in-office work, getting together for the bonding, getting together for planning or to dislodge disagreements;`

When you do remote-first well, you'll be rewarded with a much happier and effective group of people working for you. They have the time to live the lives of modern adults, where flexibility is paramount for everyone. This flexibility along with the free time of not having to worry about a commute every day make it ideal especially for families, but even that single twenty-something is going to get something out of being able to step away from their desk to go to a dentist appointment without hesitation. Trust is a two way street, and in my opinion is your most important asset as a leader: both in cultivating it for yourself and giving it to your team. All talk of keeping track of what people do every minute of the day goes right out the window with this trust. You're giving your team trust, time, flexibility and in return they'll give you more, and gladly, than they could give to a job forcing them into an office every day.

You can do a million things to do remote poorly and get results that make you think everyone needs to get back into the office because they can't be trusted, or because no one is working well together. I promise you, the problem is with the culture you helped create. Over here I'm seeing people thrive in a fully remote world.
