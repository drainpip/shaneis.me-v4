title: 'On Managing Remote'
description: "There's a lot of BS swirling around these days about companies working remotely. It seems like an endless stream of leaders are saying their companies are so much worse having gone remote. I personally think that if your business can go remote, it should. Leaders will have to work harder and be better, and this is the real problem."

I've been working remotely since the end of 2017, and I've seen the company I work for adjust how they work with remote employees evolve quite a bit in that time. Pre-pandemic we were switching to Zoom and making all communications remote-first as we could. It was nowhere near 100% asynchronous, but we were getting to the point that all meetings were over zoom even for people in the office.

Today there's a big reversal from the "remote-first utopia" that was being created during the beginning of the pandemic that is pulling people back into the office. There are many factors to this, some of which are valid in my opinion, but a vast majority of the things I've heard as reasons - stated publicly mind you - are simply due to poor leadership. Besides needing to justify the rent you're paying at the swanky downtown office, a majority of the leaders state publicly that there is no substitute for being in person every day because it's impossible to have those "water cooler" conversations or ad hoc whiteboarding sessions where so much creativity flows when you're remote. People are so much less efficient, and there's no way to ensure they're are working all day.

Bullshit.

### How to do remote well

I would like to explain how it looks and feels like when you're doing remote-first well, but before I do I think we should check in on some of the reasons why having people work remotely is a good thing.

#### Pros

From an employer's perspective:

* You can choose talent from anywhere in the world if you're heavily async, however it's probably easiest to stick within a few timezones either direction. This is vastly superior to the talent pool you'll be stuck with in the metropolitan area around whatever offices you'll have access to.
* You won't need a massive footprint for offices, this could add up to (sometimes many) multiple millions per year in savings you can put into the business.
* Being remote-first today is a differentiator in grabbing the attention of top talent.
* If you have processes in place to make remote-first work well, your business will be naturally more lean and efficient than your competition.

From an employee's perspective:

* You can live anywhere, not just in the expensive metro where the most offices are, this can make a higher salary go much further as a bonus.
* You'll have more free time in your day not having to commute, and more flexibility to take care of things during the week that are mostly impossible to do without taking time off.
* Taking care of children's school schedule, or being a caretaker to a loved one, is something you can build your day around instead of the opposite.
* It's easy to start and stop work when you want, it's not necessary to clock 8+ hours just because everyone else is still at their desks in the office.
* Much easier to have longer blocks of flow state without interruptions for deep thinking and problem solving.

#### Cons

From an employer's perspective:

* Morale is particularly difficult to manage through challenging times.
* Bringing people together, when it makes sense, is quite expensive.
* Managing processes can take more effort, knowing when something is wrong can take more time.

From an employee's perspective:

* There can be real loneliness compared to being in a thriving office, especially depending on your living situation.
* It takes real discipline to stay on task and actively working.
* Some people don't know they dislike it until they try it.
* Getting to know your coworkers takes more effort.

In most situations where having a remote workforce is possible, both employers and employees agree that the pros outweigh the cons. In some cases, like staying on task, they are the same or worse in an office.

* Remote first done well
* Good trouble
* Manufacture the bonding
* Feedback over zoom
