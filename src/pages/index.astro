        I've always had grandiose plans for a personal website that have never
        come to fruition. Instead my creative energy goes into work or fanciful
        things like writing stories for an audience of one.

      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>
        I'm pretty good at my three C's: cars, computers, and canines. I have
        been an ASE Parts Specialist so no mechanic can cheat me. I have been
        tinkering with computer hardware and programming since the early 90's. I
        also spent a few years learning about canine behavior including six
        months of direct work with a senior trainer - I did this more for
        personal learning than starting a business, but I'm certainly open to
        such things.
